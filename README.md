# 🏏Chucks 🦆

Chucks is a simple hand cricket game we(me & my friends) used to play while commuting back from school. It required 10 different hand gestures to make runs and bowl. There were two teams, one would bowl the other would bat. The game was divided into two innings. Just like the original cricket game.

There are two modes :-

1. Simple
2. Crazy
#### General Rules:-
Numbers in the range ```0-10``` are allowed, both inclusive.
#### Rules for Simple Mode:-
If the baller and batter plays the same number, the batter is declared as OUT
#### Rules for Crazy Mode:-
If the batter and baller plays the same number, the batting team can add runs to their existing score which will be equal to ```existing_score + (batter_move**2)```. In order to OUT the batsmen, baller will need to play moves such that ```abs(batter_move-baller_move)==1```. In case of ```(0,10) or (10,0)``` from either side, batter will be given OUT. In case both batter and baller chooses move ```0```, batting team will add 200 runs.
